Typenum
=====

Typenum is a Rust library for compile-time numbers. It will have its own [website](http://paholg.com/typenum/).

For more in-depth examples and documentation, see the website (in future).

Note: This library is in its infancy and is unstable, and you should expect breaking
changes for now.
